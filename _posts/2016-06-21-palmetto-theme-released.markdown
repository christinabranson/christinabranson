Today I'm releasing the beta version of my first WordPress theme. From the theme description:

> Palmetto is a WordPress theme designed specifically for real estate and rental agencies. It features modules on the home page designed to showcase featured listings. It also has a number of custom page templates, including a listing template to showcase property information.

I developed it primarily for a client called [Bluffton Homes 4 Rent](http://blufftonhomes4rent.com){:target="_blank"}, a rental real estate agent based in South Carolina. 

The source code can be found on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/christinabranson/palmetto){:target="_blank"} and you can view the demo and documentation at [christinabranson.github.io/palmetto](http://christinabranson.github.io/palmetto){:target="_blank"}.
