## Mission Statement

I'm a full-stack web developer with a specialty in PHP. I'm interested in positions that will allow me to expand my skills and work on interesting projects. You should feel free to 
[contact me](/about/hire-me/) if you have any interesting projects. I'm currently available for both full-time positions and freelance work. 

## Technical Skills
PHP, HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, MySQL, MS SQL Server, Wordpress, Java, C++, C#, Perl, Matlab/Octve, IBM Cognos,
MS Office, Nuxeo, SharePoint, Git

## Professional Experience

### Software Engineer, Archarithms Inc

Key Software Personnel for development of the web­based software aggregation and analytics component of the
United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Meter Data Management System (MDMS) where responsibilities
included:

1. Analyzed the existing MVC .NET application and MS SQL databases to determine gaps in the technical
requirements and develop software and architecture enhancements for future development

2. Modified the models and reports in the IBM Cognos business intelligence tools to fix errors and optimize
report performance

3. Supported proposal development, requirements specifications, labor estimates, and scheduling for key
software tasks for the MDMS Program

Lead developer for a PHP­based eCommerce website, [Your Wish From Me](/portfolio/yourwishfromme/), where responsibilities included:

1. Developed a minimum viable product using an existing PHP eCommerce framework, heavily modified to
integrate data from the Amazon Product Search API. The website also integrated with Facebook for login
and sharing and with various payment APIs

2. Developed an improved backend and database schema to optimize performance
    
3. Developed the front­end of the application using HTML5 and jQuery based on the Foundation framework
    
4. Developed scripts using Javascript (using CasperJS and PhantomJS) to automate purchasing and to
web­scrape missing data

Supported development for the DoD C­RAM C2 Program where responsibilities included:

1. Developed models to simulate manned and unmanned aircrafts using Java and performed analysis to
support requirements development for the C­UAS capability

2. Created analysis and log file parsing scripts utilizing Perl

### Software Engineer Intern, Optical Processing Technologies and Systems, Inc

1. Led a seminar as part of the University Of Alabama in Huntsville Mathematical Sciences Colloquium which
explored the theoretical foundation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a foundation of machine learning. Those mathematically inclined can [view the presentation](/assets/img/PCAPresentation.pdf){:target="_blank"} on this website.

2. Programmed within Octave an implementation of PCA directly from the algorithm to be used in classification
software for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and expanded the capabilities of the OCR using blob detection
and Fourier techniques to find randomly placed digits in an image

### Graduate Research Assistant, UAH Atmospheric Sciences Department

1. Performed statistical analysis to compare the performance of a control model run and an assimilated satellite
observed cloud model run in simulating cloud fraction and aerosol concentrations. The model results were evaluated
against satellite cloud cover observations and ground­based aerosol monitoring stations.

2. Wrote original code using IDL and Fortran to calculate statistics, averages, and error on separate domains and time
scales and generate graphs for visualization and presentation

3. Prepared and edited research proposals US Government agencies

## Education

### MS Atmospheric Science from University of Alabama-Huntsville
I obtained my Master's degree in Atmospheric Science from the University of Alabama-Huntsville in December 2012. My program was very programming-intensive. In addition to the research described above 
while I was a graduate research assistant at UAH, I also performed meteorological simulations and climate modeling in Matlab, statistical analysis and data visualization in IDL, and
I wrote a storm-tracking programming using mathematical morphology in Matlab.

### BS Mathematics from Rowan University
I majored in Mathematics with a minor in Physics while at Rowan, but I also discovered my real passion for programming. While at Rowan, I took several courses in C++. I also performed research in Linear Algebra 
using Mathematica. While studying, I obtained my Mathematica certification as part of the [Mathematica Student Certification Program](https://www.wolfram.com/training/certification/students/){:target="_blank"}.

## Etc
* I hold an active DoD security clearance.
* I obtained my CompTIA Security+ certification in October 2014.
