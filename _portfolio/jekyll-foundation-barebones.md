## Description
Foundation Barebones is a minimalistic Jekyll theme designed to bring elements from the Foundation front-end framework to be used in Jekyll-powered sites.
The source code can be found on [my GitHub account]() and the demo site at [Jekyll Foundation Barebones]().

The theme contains no custom CSS or Javascript, but simply defaults to the custom Foundation styling. This allows
the user to style as they desire, but still maintain easy access to the Foundation elements that make up many modern websites.

Foundation elements included:

* Mobile-first design
* Grid layouts: "feature panes", sidebar pages
* Top bar navigation (for medium or larger screens)
* Off canvas navigation (for smaller screens and mobile)
* Orbit slider
* Breadcrumbs
* Pagination
* Foundation icons
