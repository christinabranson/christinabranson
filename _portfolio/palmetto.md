Palmetto is an open-source WordPress theme designed for real estate or rental agencies. It was initially released in beta stage in June 2016. 
The source code can be found on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/christinabranson){:target="_blank"} and the [demo site](http://christinabranson.github.io/palmetto){:target="_blank"}.

> Palmetto is a WordPress theme designed specifically for real estate and rental agencies. It features modules on the home page designed to showcase featured listings. It also has a number of custom page templates, including a listing template to showcase property information.

The theme includes multiple tempalates, including:

* A custom homepage which allows web owners to showcase their featured properties, 
* A special listings template which allows users to highlight property information
* A grid template to highlight child pages, used here to show all listings

I highly recommend that you check out the [demo site](http://christinabranson.github.io/palmetto){:target="_blank"} to see all features available.
